This is my submission of this challenge.
For this one, I used Mathematica, a program that calculate math and graphs data for you. I was going to use Kaggle, but then I realized I already have Mathematica that can tackle this assignment.
What I did was input the .csv file into the program and it took all the values, make them for each their entry, and saved it as a variable. I then used commands that can convert the data into graphs, resulting in several results showing. These graphs showed which star type was most common and how the lumosity and tempature had relations to each star type the bigger and smaller it goes.
If you have Mathematica downloaded, you can simply download the file and open it in that program. Otherwise, there is a PDF version that just shows the whole thing in proper format.
Thank you so much for checking out this submission!
